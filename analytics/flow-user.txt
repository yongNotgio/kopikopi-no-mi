Username or Email
Password
Sign In button
Below the Sign In button, there is a prompt that says: “Don’t have an account? Sign Up”, which redirects the user to the Registration Page.

REGISTRATION: 
On the Registration Page, new farmers can create an account by providing their required details such as:
Name (LastName, First Name, Middle Initial)
Username or Email
Password
Contact Number
Age 	
Municipality/City
Province
Once registration is completed successfully, the user can return to the Login Page to sign in. 

When the farmer clicks the Sign In button, the system performs authentication by:
Checking if the user is registered in the database
Verifying the username/email and password
~ If the credentials are correct, the farmer is granted access and redirected to the Dashboard, where they can manage their farm-related activities.
~ If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed informing the user that the login details are invalid.

PAGE: DASHBOARD
After successful login, the user is redirected to the Dashboard, where a main button is provided to input and manage farm details.
Farm Details Registration
Upon clicking the button, the farmer is prompted to register basic farm information including:
Farm Name
Farm area
Elevation
Plant variety
Overall tree count

Once a farm already exists in the system, an additional button appears allowing the user to add clusters or groupings of coffee plants within the farm.

Cluster Registration
Each cluster represents a specific area of the farm and contains the following details:
Cluster name
Area size
Plant count
Plant stages, which can be:
Seed/Sapling
Tree
Flowering/Fruit-bearing
Ready to Harvest

Clicking on a cluster name opens a pop-up or form box where the user is prompted to input the specific data required for that cluster type.

SUB-PAGE
The farm layout is visually represented as a square or rectangular figure, with each cluster shown as a selectable section.
Seed/Sapling
Each seed or sapling cluster records:
Date planted
Number of plants
Variety
Fertilizer application frequency
Fertilizer type
Pesticide type 
Pesticide application frequency
Agro-climatic [monhtly taemperature, rainfall, humidity] 
Soil pH
Tree 
These stages include:
Date planted
Number of plants
Variety
Fertilizer application frequency
Fertilizer type
Pesticide and application frequency
Last harvested date
Previous coffee yield (kg)
Last pruned date
Presence of shade trees
Agro-climatic [monhtly temperature, rainfall, humidity] 
Soil pH
Flowering/FruitBearing
These stages include:
Date planted
Number of plants
Variety
Fertilizer application frequency
Fertilizer type
Pesticide and application frequency
Last harvested date
Previous coffee yield (kg)
Last pruned date
Presence of shade trees
Agro-climatic [monthly temperature, rainfall, humidity] 
Soil pH
Estimated flowering date (?)
Ready to Harvest
This stage contains more advanced production data:
Date planted
Number of plants
Variety
Fertilizer application frequency
Fertilizer type
Pesticide type
Pesticide application frequency
Harvest date
Previous yield
Predicted yield
Date & Season of Harvest
Current/Actual yield
Proportion of each coffee grade
Last pruned date
Agro-climatic [monthly temperature, rainfall, humidity] 
Soil pH
Shade trees
Estimated harvest date
	
	For Harvest Monitoring: 
	    For Pre-Harvest, the system records:
Last harvest date
Total number of trees
Yielded coffee in kilograms
Quantity per grade:
Highest Grade – Fine
Middle – Premium
Lowest Grade – Commercial

For Post-Harvest, it captures:
Current harvest yield
Proportions of each grade
Defect count
Bean moisture content
Bean screen size

PAGE: HARVEST RECORDS & FORECAST
Next to the Dashboard is the Harvest Records & Forecast Page, which serves as the centralized area for monitoring historical performance and future yield predictions.

When the page loads, it initially displays a list of all clusters that are:
Ready to harvest
Currently flowering or
Already fruit-bearing
Each cluster in the list shows a quick summary including:
Cluster ID  
Cluster Name
Plant variety
Tree count
Latest harvest season
Latest predicted yield
This allows farmers to quickly identify active production areas.

~ Cluster Detail Overlay / Expanded View
Upon clicking a cluster, a detailed panel or overlay appears displaying complete cluster information.
Cluster Information
This includes
Cluster ID
Plant ID
Tree Count
Plant Age
Variety
Elevation
Planting Date
Flowering/Fruitbearing Date
Expected Harvest Date
Plant Management Status [
Fertilizer Type
Fertilizer application frequency 
Pesticide Type
Pesticide Application Frequency
Date last pruned
Presence of shade trees
Soil pH (???)
Yield & Forecast Data
The system then presents 
Previous coffee yield per harvest season
Current season predicted yield
Actual harvested yield 
Proportion of yield by grade:
Fine
Premium
Commercial
Analytics/Forecast Section
Within the same overlay, charts are displayed for easier interpretation:
Line charts showing yield trends across harvest seasons
Bar charts showing grade distribution per season
Comparison charts for:
Predicted vs actual yield
Previous vs current season yield
	
This page has filters option. It can filter data by:
Harvest Season (Example Harvest Season 2022-2023)
	

PAGE: Decision Support/Recommendations Page?
The Decision Support & Recommendation Page provides farmers with actionable insights and best practices based on the performance and condition of their clusters.
This page analyzes production data, crop status, and environmental factors to help improve yield and farm management.

Upon landing on the page, the system displays a list of clusters with performance indicators such as:
High yield
Moderate yield
Poor or declining yield
Each cluster is visually tagged (example: warning icons or color levels) to quickly highlight areas needing attention.

Problem Identification:
For clusters with poor or declining yield, the system automatically identifies possible contributing factors, including:
Insufficient fertilizer application
Incorrect fertilizer type
Lack of pesticide use or pest infestation
Delayed or missed pruning
Extreme or imbalanced soil pH
Presence of diseases or pests
Weather or climate stress (excess rain, drought, temperature extremes)
Poor shade tree management
Each factor is displayed with short explanations based on the cluster’s recorded data.

Subpage/Overlay:
Recommendation & Best Practices
For every identified issue, the system generates targeted recommendations. These recommendations are derived from coffee farming handbooks, guidebooks, and agricultural best practices (ATI, ONS, CQI) 

The page also ranks clusters based on urgency of intervention, showing:
Clusters with critical yield drop
Clusters with moderate issues
Clusters performing well

This allows farmers to:
Focus on high-priority problem areas first
Allocate resources efficiently
Plan farm activities strategically

For filters, farmers can filter clusters by:
Yield performance (low, medium, high)
Harvest Season
